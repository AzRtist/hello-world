# hello-world
Just another repository. 
I'm a day old Githubber and still trying to figure out what it's all about and how it works.

Now I can add more text, then I have to do a pull request, and then a commit. I think.

And now I'm going to add another paragraph here, and see if I remember what to do next. I'd really like to learn how to set this up on my local machine and use Git to push updates to a live server one day.

One more thing, this is so confusing.
